                "description": "<p>The University of California, Berkeley was chartered in 1868, and its flagship campus \u2014 envisioned as a \"City of Learning\" \u2014 was established at Berkeley, on San Francisco Bay. Berkeley faculty consists of 1,582 full-time and 500 part-time faculty members dispersed among more than 130 academic departments and more than 80 interdisciplinary research units. Berkeley alumni have received 28 Nobel prizes, and there are eight Nobel Laureates, 32 MacArthur Fellows, and four Pulitzer Prize winners among the current faculty.</p>\n<p>In September 2012, to mark Berkeley's commitment to innovation in teaching and learning, The Berkeley Resource Center for Online Education (BRCOE) was formed. The Center is a resource hub and an operational catalyst for all internal campus-wide and external resources to advise, coordinate, and facilitate the University\u2019s online education initiatives, ranging from credit and non-credit courses, to online degree programs and MOOC projects, including the MOOCLab initiative. </p>\n<p>BRCOE's new MOOCLab is a three-year research initiative to fund and develop Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as vehicles for pedagogical research in online education.</p>\n<p>Berkeley is also working with edX to develop and foster adoption of Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs) on campuses around the world. SPOCs are designed to supplement and enhance the learning experience of on-campus students, while providing local faculty an opportunity for more interactive activities and more time for \u201chigh-touch\u201d pedagogy.</p>\n<p>Join us on Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/berkeleyonline\">BerkeleyX</a>.</p>",

This gives the University a very important role, not only in professional training, but also in the generation of knowledge, that responds to the needs of an increasingly competitive world, becoming an excellent choice for the education of the Guatemalan and Latin American new generations.  </p>\n<p>Galileo has experienced significant growth during the past few years, this has been regarded as extraordinary. This growth has not only been in the number of students, but also in the number of offered programs, research lines, publications, joint programs with government institutions and corporate organizations, and international projects with the objective to contribute to the development of Higher education. MOOC's pioneer in Latin America, which aims to give all people access to high quality academic courses developed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers, bringing together worldwide academics and students; all this has made of Galileo one of the most important universities in the Central and Latin American region. All this is a direct result of a clear vision and a firm commitment to it.</p>",

The institute has a faculty of industry leaders and offers a range of program delivery options, including virtual, self-study, online courses, and in-person classes. Its US customers include the SEC, the Treasury, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and most leading worldwide banks.</p>\n<p>AN IMPRESSIVE HISTORY STANDS BEHIND YOUR IMPRESSIVE FUTURE</p>",

In 1921:</p>\n<p><em>\u201cIt became evident that, for the sake of the business itself and for the sake of the thousands of young men and women employed by the Exchange and by its member firms, some method should be devised whereby they might learn the fundamentals; the reasons why they did the things which occupied their working days.\u201d</em> NYSE president Charles Gay, 1921. This was the inspiration behind the establishment of the New York Institute of Finance In 1922.</p>\n<p>NYIF courses cover everything from investment banking, asset pricing, insurance and market structure to financial modeling, treasury operations, and accounting. The institute has a faculty of industry leaders and offers a range of program delivery options, including virtual, self-study, online courses, and in-person classes. Its US customers include the SEC, the Treasury, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and most leading worldwide banks.</p>\n<p>AN IMPRESSIVE HISTORY STANDS BEHIND YOUR IMPRESSIVE FUTURE</p>",

This gives the University a very important role, not only in professional training, but also in the generation of knowledge, that responds to the needs of an increasingly competitive world, becoming an excellent choice for the education of the Guatemalan and Latin American new generations.  </p>\n<p>Galileo has experienced significant growth during the past few years, this has been regarded as extraordinary. This growth has not only been in the number of students, but also in the number of offered programs, research lines, publications, joint programs with government institutions and corporate organizations, and international projects with the objective to contribute to the development of Higher education.

Berkeley faculty consists of 1,582 full-time and 500 part-time faculty members dispersed among more than 130 academic departments and more than 80 interdisciplinary research units. Berkeley alumni have received 28 Nobel prizes, and there are eight Nobel Laureates, 32 MacArthur Fellows, and four Pulitzer Prize winners among the current faculty.</p>\n<p>In September 2012, to mark Berkeley's commitment to innovation in teaching and learning, The Berkeley Resource Center for Online Education (BRCOE) was formed. The Center is a resource hub and an operational catalyst for all internal campus-wide and external resources to advise, coordinate, and facilitate the University\u2019s online education initiatives, ranging from credit and non-credit courses, to online degree programs and MOOC projects, including the MOOCLab initiative. </p>\n<p>BRCOE's new MOOCLab is a three-year research initiative to fund and develop Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as vehicles for pedagogical research in online education.</p>\n<p>Berkeley is also working with edX to develop and foster adoption of Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs) on campuses around the world. SPOCs are designed to supplement and enhance the learning experience of on-campus students, while providing local faculty an opportunity for more interactive activities and more time for \u201chigh-touch\u201d pedagogy.</p>\n<p>Join us on Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/berkeleyonline\">BerkeleyX</a>.</p>",

This was the inspiration behind the establishment of the New York Institute of Finance In 1922.</p>\n<p>NYIF courses cover everything from investment banking, asset pricing, insurance and market structure to financial modeling, treasury operations, and accounting.

The Center is a resource hub and an operational catalyst for all internal campus-wide and external resources to advise, coordinate, and facilitate the University\u2019s online education initiatives, ranging from credit and non-credit courses, to online degree programs and MOOC projects, including the MOOCLab initiative. </p>\n<p>BRCOE's new MOOCLab is a three-year research initiative to fund and develop Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as vehicles for pedagogical research in online education.</p>\n<p>Berkeley is also working with edX to develop and foster adoption of Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs) on campuses around the world. SPOCs are designed to supplement and enhance the learning experience of on-campus students, while providing local faculty an opportunity for more interactive activities and more time for \u201chigh-touch\u201d pedagogy.</p>\n<p>Join us on Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/berkeleyonline\">BerkeleyX</a>.</p>",
